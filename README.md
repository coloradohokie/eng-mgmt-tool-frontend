# Structural Engineering Project Manager
This app was created for a client that wanted an automated way to manage their projects for their clients. They were a consultant who worked at a structural engineering firm and they wanted a way to manage their proposals, projects, and report their weekly progress to their manager.


It has several features:
* User Authentication
* Project Management
* Proposal Management
* Conversion of a Proposal to a Project
* Weekly Reporting Tool

This is a highly specialized application and is not intended for general use.

The code base of this project is split into a frontend and a backend to maintain portability. The frontend is hosted on michaelnewman.dev/apps/engineering_project_manager. The backend is hosted on heroku.


## Languages
The frontend of this project is written entirely in React/JavaScript ES6, CSS, and HTML. The backend is written in Ruby. An API connects the frontend to the backend.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

All npm scripts are available:
* `npm start`
* `npm test`
* `npm run build`
* `npm run eject`


## History
This project was originally my Mod 4 project while attending Flatiron School. Unlike most school projects, this had a client with a list of needs which needed to be met in order for the project to be successful. This meant that if something was outside of my knowledge, I needed to learn it; I couldn't just pretend that the feature wasn't part of the original scope. I wanted to develop it this way because I felt like this approach was similar to real-world experience.

This project has been deployed and used by the client. Due to privacy concerns, the location of that install is not being reported.
